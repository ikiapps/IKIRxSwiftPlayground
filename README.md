# IKIRxSwiftPlayground

![Implementation of Hello World in the RxSwift playground.](https://www.ikiapps.com/img/2017-05-18-iki-rxswift-playground/hello-world-in-iki-rxswift-playground.png)

This is a premade workspace with a playground that imports RxSwift and RxCocoa.

The frameworks were installed using Cocoapods and can be updated using pod update.

Within the `Sources` folder there is a copy of [IKILogger](https://github.com/ikiapps/IKILogger) for colorful logging.

The target `IKIRxSwiftPlayground` needs to be built before the playground will evaluate code.

The playground was tested with Xcode 8.3.2.
